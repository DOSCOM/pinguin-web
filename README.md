## Development

with power of [react](https://reactjs.org), we use components for composing the website.

knowledge about jsx and es6+ features will help a lot. you can learn it along with react and gatsby in parallel

we use 3rd party components such as [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) (bootstrap for react) to simplify development, instead write our own components from scratch. feel free to add another 3rd party components from internet. so many of them are beautiful

also consider read about [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design). it's awesome

### Styling
we use css module for styling. place the styles on `src/assets/style/module`

name the css module with the name of the component. such as `<ComponentName>.module.css`
